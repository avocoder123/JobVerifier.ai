        "The rise of fraudulent job postings has become a significant issue, leading to wasted time, lost opportunities, and potential scams targeting job seekers. Many individuals unknowingly apply to fake job listings, which can result in frustration, financial loss, and even identity theft. This AI application/data analysis tool is designed to address this problem by analyzing job postings and distinguishing between real and fraudulent listings based on the provided data. By offering insights into the prevalence of fake jobs, this tool helps job seekers make informed decisions, reducing the risk of falling victim to scams. The expected impact is substantial, as it can save job seekers valuable time, enhance trust in online job markets, and contribute to a more transparent and secure employment landscape.\n",

        "\n",
        "A fraudulent job detection tool benefits job seekers by protecting them from scams, financial loss, and wasted time, while also helping job portals maintain credibility by filtering out fake listings. Employers and recruiters can safeguard their brands from misuse, and government agencies can use the tool to combat employment fraud. Career coaches and employment agencies can ensure their clients apply to legitimate opportunities, while cybersecurity teams can leverage it to detect fraud patterns. Overall, this tool enhances job market security, transparency, and trust for all stakeholders. By integrating this AI tool, portals can detect and remove fraudulent postings, enhancing trust and user satisfaction. Potential use cases include job boards using this technology to automatically vet listings before they go live and job seekers leveraging the tool to verify postings before applying. Ultimately, this solution creates a safer and more transparent job search experience for everyone involved.\n",

        "The project domain falls under fraud detection in online job postings, specifically within the fields of natural language processing (NLP), machine learning, and cybersecurity. It focuses on analyzing job descriptions to identify fraudulent listings, making it relevant to areas such as employment analytics, recruitment technology, and online safety.\n",

It can help identify key traits (e.g., words, entities, phrases) common in fake job postings. Additionally, a contextual embedding model can be used to find similar job descriptions, and exploratory data analysis (EDA) can uncover insights within the dataset.\n",
